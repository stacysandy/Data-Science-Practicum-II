# Title: Colorado K-12 Financial Transparency – An Exploratory Data Science Comparison Across Schools

# High level description of the project
In this past academic year, my kindergartner son has brought home 5 different fundraisers and a quarterly scholastic book fair flyer. Unfortunately, I am unclear where the funding is going, what the funding is for, and how fundraisers feed into the school. These implications on the school and district fundraiser efforts need further analysis. Especially since school ends in a little over two months, I am curious to learn how expenses are handled. The primary research question is to address how financial expenditures are being spent across K through 12 schools in Colorado. An exploratory data science approach will be conducted to answer this research question. Overall, what are the school expenses that impact our children’s educational needs? These high level research questions may expand upon themselves as the exploratory data analysis (EDA) can lead to other areas of interest. As well as, the unknown world of what is contained within this data.

# Type of data science task
•	Regression using supervised machine learning 
•	Linear regression to find relationship(s) between different expenses across schools and/or districts
•	ANOVA analysis of variance on data
•	Possible KNN analysis on the clustering of different types of expenses to demonstrate possible clusters of similar or different data points
•	Data visualization(s) to show expenses of K-12 schools in Colorado 
•	Data visualization(s) to conduct a comparison and contrast of data.
