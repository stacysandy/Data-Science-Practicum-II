All the numbers within each column are numerical values that are tied to unique identifiers within the Chart of Accounts. Except for the column <b>amount_cents</b>.

For example: school code 100 indicates elemetary schools. Therefore, it would never make sense to add these numerical values or numbers together within each column. The unique id of school code and adding to another unique id fund code, wouldn't make sense in this data set.

2) All amounts are displayed with cents and without decimal places. E.g. the value $5.42 will be recorded as 542

2) All amounts are displayed with cents and without decimal places. E.g. the value $5.42 will be recorded as 542. <br>

Location codes 900 through 969, which are reserved exclusively for charter schools, are required for recording charter school revenues and expenditures and balance sheet.

So that the level can be identified, the following structure must be used when assigning location codes.   

* Locations 900 through 919 are used for elementary charter schools.
* Locations 920 through 929 are used for middle school (jar high) charter schools.

SREs and sub-SREs consist of activities which have somewhat the same general operational objectives.  Categories of activities comprising each of the divisions and subdivisions are grouped according to the principle that the activities can be combined, compared, related, and mutually exclusive.

<B>The use of the SRE is voluntary. Nonetheless and as with all non-required (non-bolded) items, it is recommended that if a district chooses to implement this element, tot follow the scheme provided below.</B>

"<b>Source/Object/Balance Sheet</b> - a combination dimension which is used to identify the type of account: Balance Sheet, Revenue (Sources), or Expenditure (Object).  Object is the service or commodity obtained" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 6).

NOTE:
<br>
"The Object/Source/Balance Sheet is the eighth code of the account string.  It is a multiplepurpose four-digit code.  The first digit identifies the account type and determines the dimension and purpose. See details below." (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 123).

Within the Colorado Department of Education Financial Prolicies and Procedures Chart of Accounts (fiscal year 2016-2017), Object Source Code or Source/Object code are defined as an account code element:

"The following illustrations present the basic account code structure for each account type by a series of Xs and hyphens.  Each X designates the placement of a numerical digit (which can include zero) in the account code" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 8). (More information later on the account code structure.)

"Offset to Source Codes 1956, 3956, and 4956, used with the appropriate grant code, which may be zero" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 134).

"Offset to Object Code 0596, used with the appropriate grant code, which may be zero" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 151).

DEFINITION:
<br>
"<b>Job Classification</b> - a dimension which enables school districts to break down expenditures for salaries and employee benefits by the employee’s job classification" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 6).

NOTE:
<br>
"The job classification dimension enables school district to break down expenditures for salaries and employee benefits by the employee's job classification.  This dimension is used at least three ways in school accounting:  (1) to classify payroll costs for personnel purposes; (2) to segregate certified and non-certified salaries and benefits; and, (3) to accumulate payroll costs by bargaining unit for purposes of labor negotiations" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 167).

"Currently, the required reporting level of detail for this dimension for Finance December Data Pipeline is minimal (100 Administrator; 200 Professional - Instructional; 300 Professional - Other; 400 Paraprofessional; 500 Office/Administrative Support; and, 600 Crafts, Trades, and Services)" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 167).

REMEMBER:
<br>
"The job classification dimension applies only to expenditure accounts with object codes 0100 through 0299.  The job classification dimension is not applicable for: expenditure accounts with object codes 0300 to 0999; revenue accounts; or, balance sheet accounts" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 167).

" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 6).

NOTE:
<br>
"This dimension is intended to provide a means of segregating financial data associated with specific grants and categorical funding projects.  A GRANT is an award of financial assistance in the form of cash or a contribution or gift of other assets from another government to an eligible grantee to be used for a specified or designated purpose, activity, or facility.  Categorical funding is financial assistance to help offset costs of providing services related to specific PROJECTS such as Vocational Education, Exceptional Children’s Educational Act (which includes special education, and gifted and talented education), and English Language Proficiency Act" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 184).

REMEMBER:
<br>
"The designated grants/projects dimension serves a dual purpose:  verifying that special grant and project revenues which are provided for specified or designated purposes are expended for those purposes; and, identifying total project expenditures--regardless of, and in excess of, special revenue.  Project expenditures in excess of categorical revenues are assumed to be subsidies" (CDE, <i>FY16-17 Chart of Accounts</i>, p. 184).

The grant/project code is a four-digit code.  The first digit identifies the revenue source of the grant or project as local, intermediate, state, or federal.  The second, third, and fourth digits are defined by the district for local and intermediate grants, and by the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) for state and federal grants.

## <center>Further EDA</center>

MARKDOWN:
### My Midway SUMMARY of FINDINGS:

It seems a lot of the financial codes used within the dataset are either related in some way or by no means is there a known correlation. Depending on the funding reasons, there are many anomalies and outliers to consider. Further Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) needs to be conducted. While I have personally found some columns that may not necessarily provide vital information to the purpose of the project, I believe that I will not be able to get to the root cause of the project research questions without eliminating those columns of little value. <b>In particular to reaching some solid answers to complete this project, I have made the executive decision to omit <u>sre_code, job_class_code, and grant_code</u>.</b> Each of these columns contain values that do not pertain to why funding is spent but rather special circumstances within the spent funds of the Colorado K12 Financial Transparency data set. <b>I have also made the decision to omit any <u>zero</u> value codes as it doesn't feed into the project objectives.</b>

Moving on and as suggested by fellow peers, I will subset column values as I move forward. First, let's see what we can learn from grouping columns and bring further breadth of knowledge to what can be of benefit.

Moving onto add decimals since commas are in the wrong place with decimals....!!!!

Thanks to Professor Nathan George, he provided a helpful function to convert the column amount_cents to string and then back to float with the decimal in the correct place for the last 2 digits as the cents part of the currency value. I made a minor adjustment to the function and requested the return to contain the '.' (decimal) peice of the currency value.

### Now, notice the numbers in the amount_cents column are showing as integers and whole numbers. We will have to think about adding decimals and commas to represent those column values as currency.

REMEMBER FROM ABOVE: When summarizing this information there are three important points to keep in mind:<br>
2) All amounts are displayed with cents and without decimal places. E.g. the value $5.42 will be recorded as 542. <br>

For the moment being, we will leave the column values as intergers for visualization purposes and move them to categorical values when it is time to conduct machine learning algorithms.
